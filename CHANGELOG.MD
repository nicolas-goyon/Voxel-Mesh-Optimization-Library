---
## [v1.1.0] - 2025-08-22
### Added
- OBJ exporter and simple chunk save/load helpers.
- Perlin noise chunk generator and example usage.
- Benchmark suite with GitHub Action checks and published results.
- NuGet package publication with package readme.

### Changed
- Documentation refreshed to describe current workflow and features.

## [v1.0.1] - 2025-04-19
### Changed
- **DisjointSet plane optimization:**
  - Remove legacy ToResult method
  - Updated test logic
  - File renamed


## [v1.0.0] - 2025-04-19
### Added
- **End-To-End Logic :**
  - DisjointSetOptimizer done
  - Full tests added
### Upcoming
- Maintainablility refactor
- SIMD/Vectorization operation


## [v0.1.0] - 2025-04-11
### Added
- **Occlusion Logic:**
  - Implemented and tested occlusion functionality for extracting visible voxel faces.
- **2D Disjoint Set Algorithm:**
  - Completed and tested the 2D disjoint set algorithm for mesh optimization.
- **Core Representations:**
  - Basic implementations for voxel, chunk, and mesh representations.
- **Example Application:**
  - A console application demonstrating basic usage of the library.

### Incomplete / Pending Implementation
- **End-to-End Integration Method:**
  - A final integration method that should:
    - Use the occlusion logic to extract all visible faces.
    - Optimize these faces using the 2D disjoint set algorithm.
    - Generate an optimized mesh from the processed data.

  *Note: This integration is ~90% complete. Final adjustments are needed to close the end-to-end workflow, which is crucial for
 the upcoming v1 release featuring a fully working implementation.*

### Changed
- Established the initial project structure with a clear separation between core functionality, examples, and tests.

### Fixed
- Addressed minor issues in the test harness for occlusion processing and the disjoint set algorithm.
